How to work better with Stephen.

Hi nice to see you reading this. The tl;dr of me is: I am all about culture, bringing the customer's voice into our Product discussions and maximising our team happiness.



**My Basic Preferences**

You can Slack me 24 hours a day. I like responding quickly. I don't expect you to be the same.

If I am traveling, I will give you notice of said travel in advance. We have a shared team calendar: use it to note your leave and travels too. I will reciprocate. I prefer not to have our standard meeting schedule whilst travelling, but happy to make exceptions.

I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend. I might Slack or email you things, but I won't expect immediate responses.

I take vacations. You should too. Furthermore: holidays are meant to relax, so disable ALL notifications please.

**Heavier stuff**

I believe 100% in what Tony Hsieh calls "collisions". Collisions are unscientific, hard-to-prove, but basically boil down to "serendipitous meetings". I see my main job in *OLX* to be the person that makes sure our company has as many "collisions" as possible.

Humans first. I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans build fantastic product. I optimize for the humans. Other leaders will maximize the business, the technology, or any other number of important facets. Ideological diversity is key to an effective team. All perspectives are relevant, and we need all these leaders, but my bias is towards building productive humans.

Leadership comes from everywhere... but I also believe that a big part of our culture relies on the way I behave.

I see things as systems. I reduce all complex things (including humans) into systems. I think in flowcharts. I take great joy in attempting to understand how these systems and flowcharts all fit together. When I see large or small inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

It is important to me that humans are treated fairly. I believe that most humans are trying to to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity.

I heavily bias towards action. Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things. I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere… all the time.

I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved. This has worked out well for me over my career.

I need you to know that sometimes we are in HIGH ALERT and things will get strange. There is an exception to many of my practices and principles and that is when we are in a HIGH ALERT situation. HIGH ALERT conditions usually involve existential threats to our company. During this time, my usual people, process, and product protocols are secondary to countering this threat. If it is not obvious, I will alert you that I am in this state along with my best guess of when we’ll be done. If I am constantly in this state, something is fundamentally wrong.

**Something on Feedback**

We can't do our jobs properly without really direct feedback.

At **OLX** there is a formal feedback cycle which occurs twice a year. We deliberately decoupled our OKRs from our personal goals. This means we'll evaluate only personal growth in our bi-annual performance chat.

In our formal face-to-face meeting, we’ll discuss and agree on your plan and key objectives for the next period, and I’ll ask for feedback on my performance.

Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.

**My Ideal Week in Product**

Planning meeting

Our 1:1

Celebration

In-between: constant brainstorming Asynchronously via Slack, Email etc.

**More About Meetings**

My calendar is open and public. Often it will contain big blocks of time -- I might look busy, but in actual fact I am just preventing unnecessary meetings.

If we HAVE to do a meeting, I really prefer if people share a pre-read

I expect you to minimise meetings too.

**Some More Thoughts**

Gosh I hate meetings, I would really prefer not to have any. The only meetings I love are (in order of importance): our weekly 1:1, Monday planning, Friday celebration. Everything else needs a clear goal decision associated with it and definable value.

I love taking in interest in topics that are outside of work -- both in my interests and yours. If it ever feels like we are talking too much shit or wasting time, let me know.

Often times I would issue you tasks without knowing all the details you do -- call me out on this if the details are unclear or the scope of it under-appreciated.

I respond super well if you ask me directly for help, but I struggle with direct instructions (e.g. help me do X vs. Stephen, do X)

I can be hyperbolic but it’s almost always because I am excited about the topic. I also enjoy swearing. Please tell me if you find it offensive.

I love to start new things but I often lose interest when I can mentally see how the thing is going to finish. Challenge me directly if you see my operational interest waning on a topic where you expect it more.

I struggle to focus on work if something at home is not going well.

People who treat others unfairly are a trigger for me. Unfairness in general drives me nuts.

**Some thoughts on OLX**

It is going to take at least Quarter to figure out **OLX**. DON'T be demotivated by the size and complexity: people are generally very friendly.

A huge part of being successful at this company is being curious... figure out who does similar things / topics than you and befriend them. Use slack, email, workplace, social engineering, whatever it takes
